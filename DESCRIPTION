Description: This package implements the approaches for ROC surface analysis in the setting of clustered data. 
  In particular, the following quantities are estimated: 
  (i) the covariate-specific ROC surface; 
  (ii) the covariate-specific volume under ROC surface (VUS); 
  (iii) the covariate-specific optimal pairs of thresholds. 
  The selection methods are: Generalized Youden Index (GYI), Closest to Perfection (CtP) and Max Volume (MV).
