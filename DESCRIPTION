Description: Statistical methods for ROC surface analysis in three-class classification problems for clustered data and in presence of covariates. In particular, the package allows to obtain covariate-specific point and interval estimation for:
  (i) true class fractions (TCFs) at fixed pairs of thresholds;
  (ii) the ROC surface;
  (iii) the volume under ROC surface (VUS);
  (iv) the optimal pairs of thresholds.
  Methods considered in points (i), (ii) and (iv) are proposed and discussed in To et al. (2022) <doi:10.1177/09622802221089029>. Referring to point (iv), three  different selection criteria are implemented: Generalized Youden Index (GYI), Closest to Perfection (CtP) and Maximum Volume (MV). Methods considered in point (iii) are proposed and discussed in Xiong et al. (2018) <doi:10.1177/0962280217742539>. Visualization tools are also provided. We refer readers to the articles cited above for all details.
